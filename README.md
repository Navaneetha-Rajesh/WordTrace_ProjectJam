# WordTrace

**WordTrace** is a process-based authorship transparency platform designed to restore trust in academic writing in the age of AI.

Traditional AI detection tools analyze only the final output and often produce false positives, leading to unfair accusations and academic stress. WordTrace shifts the focus from output to process verification by tracking how a document is written — not just what is submitted. By logging real-time writing behavior, detecting paste events, capturing document snapshots, and generating authorship confidence scores, WordTrace provides educators with contextual transparency instead of black-box suspicion.
